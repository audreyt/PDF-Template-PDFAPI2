=head1 NAME

PDF::Template::Container::Always

=head1 PURPOSE

To require that any child of this node will always render on every page.
Normally, a node will not render on a given page if a node before it has
triggered a pagebreak. ALWAYS nodes will always render on every page.

Primarily, this is used as a base class for HEADER and FOOTER. However, you
might want something to always render on every page outside the header and
footer areas. For example, a watermark.
