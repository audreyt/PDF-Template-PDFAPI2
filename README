PDF::Template is a layout system that creates Adobe PDF files from the same
data structure used by HTML::Template.

This distribution is a development-in-progress fork by Autrijus Tang,
with full intentions to remerge to the main PDF::Template tree
at some point.

The official maintainer of the PDF::Template module is Rob Kinyon.
